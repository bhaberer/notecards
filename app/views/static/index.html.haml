  %h1 Welcome to 356Cards
  %p
    I started this project as a digitalization of a concept my wife found on a
    crafty site. Take a box, fill it with 365 cards (one for every day of the year)
    and on each day fill out a short bit about what you did. Drop in a photo.
    A postcard. Whatever. Over time you'll fill up the cards with notes about
    events, people, and places that you would have forgotten.

    Since it's private, you can be mundane and boring. Be honest about what you
    want to remember about that day.

    I'm still building, but you're free to try it out.
